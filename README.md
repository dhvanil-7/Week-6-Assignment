# Week-6-Assignment
File ingestion and schema validation using Dask,Pandas,Modin

Pandas VS Dask
Pandas takes time for reading datas but computation is done fast. Dask takes less time for reading big files but computational tasks are time consuming.
As the assignment is focused mainly for reading and transforming the data, Dask is used for fast processing.
